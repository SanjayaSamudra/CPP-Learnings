#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Hello World";
	return 0;
}

// Important facts regarding this simple code

// 1. #include <iostream> 
//			Refers to as Header file. 
//			This code gives the user to use input, output operations to carry out.

// 2. using namespace std;
//			Use names for objects & variables from the standard library.
//			Basically that means 'namespace' provide scope for identifiers (like variables, objects etc).
//          Basically 'std' means standard, contains standard C++ library components.

// A free newline given there is to make our code clean & nice. No specific task there.

// 3. int main() {}
//			Here 'int' means, return type. In this case it says to return integers.
//			Here 'main()' refers to main function in the given code. Present of main function 'main()' is a must and you cannot change it.
//			Here function body start with the opening bracket of curly brackets ({) and ends with closing bracket of curly bracket (}).   

// 4. cout << "Hello World";
//			Here 'cout; refers to character output.
//			'<<' refers the insertion operator.
//			So all together cout with insertion operator (<<) followed with double quotes ("") end with semicolon (;) is the complete code.
//			Within the double quotes we are including what needs to be printed out.

// 5. return 0;
//			This confirms that main function executed successfully.
//			Though above line is a statement, we have to end that line with semicolon(;).
